# Module 5 |  Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Here are three key observations between June and December Temperatures.

 - Based on the median and minimum, the temperatures are higher in June, but not significantly.
 - Even the maximum temperatures and temperatures were not too different.  The minimum temperatures have a higher difference with december being a decent bit lower, but not the same as we'd expect in other locations
 - The temperatures variance is also relatively steady between the two months, though with slightly more in December

## Summary
Oahu seems like a generally good location in regards to temperature.  There is not much difference between the two months of June and December, though what difference there is exists with warmer more consistent low temperatures in June.

However looking at additional information from two additional queries, it does seem there is a decent chance of more rain in December than June, with about a 50% increase from June to December.  So when thinking of timing by year, that is also something to keep in mind.
